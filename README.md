# Analyst Builder Python Projects

This repository contains my growing collection of Python projects from the **Analyst Builder** program and other analytics practice.  
Each project demonstrates a specific skill or concept in data analytics, automation, or business intelligence, with explanations, importance, and real-world applications.

## Projects
### 1. Unit of Measurement Converter
This Python script converts values between inches, feet, and yards. It accepts different variations of unit names (e.g., "inch", "inches", "in") and returns rounded results for clarity. The converter is useful in construction, e-commerce, and education, helping users quickly standardize measurements, reduce manual calculation errors, and save time in repetitive conversions.

### 2. Calculator
This Python program performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports multiple input variations for each operation (e.g., "A", "ADD", "ADDITION") and can handle repeated calculations in a single run. The calculator is useful for quick, on-demand computations in both learning and everyday scenarios, reducing the need for manual calculations and enabling consistent, error-free results.

### 3. Automatic File Sorter
This Python script organizes files in a specified directory by automatically moving them into predefined folders based on file type (e.g., CSV files, text files, images). It creates missing folders when needed and prevents duplicate moves by checking if the file already exists in the target location. This tool is useful for keeping workspaces tidy, improving file retrieval efficiency, and automating repetitive file management tasks.

### 4. Automated Web Scraper
This Python script uses BeautifulSoup to extract real-time Bitcoin price data from CoinMarketCap at set intervals and stores it in a CSV file. It runs continuously, appending new data with timestamps, making it ideal for tracking price trends over time. Such automation is valuable for cryptocurrency traders, data analysts, and researchers who need up-to-date market data without manual checks.
