## Projects
### 1. Unit of Measurement Converter
This Python script converts values between inches, feet, and yards. It accepts different variations of unit names (e.g., "inch", "inches", "in") and returns rounded results for clarity. The converter is useful in construction, e-commerce, and education, helping users quickly standardize measurements, reduce manual calculation errors, and save time in repetitive conversions.

### 2. Calculator
This Python program performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports multiple input variations for each operation (e.g., "A", "ADD", "ADDITION") and can handle repeated calculations in a single run. The calculator is useful for quick, on-demand computations in both learning and everyday scenarios, reducing the need for manual calculations and enabling consistent, error-free results.

### 3. Automatic File Sorter
This Python script organizes files in a specified directory by automatically moving them into predefined folders based on file type (e.g., CSV files, text files, images). It creates missing folders when needed and prevents duplicate moves by checking if the file already exists in the target location. This tool is useful for keeping workspaces tidy, improving file retrieval efficiency, and automating repetitive file management tasks.

### 4. Automated Web Scraper
This Python script uses BeautifulSoup to extract real-time Bitcoin price data from CoinMarketCap at set intervals and stores it in a CSV file. It runs continuously, appending new data with timestamps, making it ideal for tracking price trends over time. Such automation is valuable for cryptocurrency traders, data analysts, and researchers who need up-to-date market data without manual checks.

### 5. Web Scraping, Regular Expressions, and Pandas
This Python script scrapes Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech from a public website using BeautifulSoup and Requests, then applies Regular Expressions to clean and preprocess the text. The cleaned transcript is tokenized into words, converted to lowercase, and analyzed with Pandas to identify the most frequently used words. This project demonstrates how to combine web scraping, regex, and data analysis to extract insights from unstructured text data.
